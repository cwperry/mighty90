### 20 June 1944
From the Mighty Ninety cruise book:
After the final fitting out at the Navy Yard, Philadelphia, we put out to sea in June for our shakedown cruise and our first taste of the work that lay ahead. The first night at sea was stormy and most of us had a bad case of ‘mal-de-mer’, but since that initiation we have ridden the best the sea has to offer without a qualm.

Although not mentioned in the Mighty Ninety cruise book, during her shakedown USS Astoria developed a significant propulsion system problem. A few hours into the cruise, a bearing failed on her number two low pressure turbine causing the engine to fail. Astoria would have to complete her shakedown cruise with only partial propulsion.

From Astoria's Cruise Book:
It was drill, drill, drill, day and night; and battle problems, abandon ship, surprise firing and tracking drill. The words, “this will be a dummy run,” were hammered into our brains until we thought there could be no more. We didn’t know much when we started, but we learned fast and continuously.
