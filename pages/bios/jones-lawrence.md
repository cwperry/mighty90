My interest in the Mighty Ninety, her crew, and experiences stems from a personal connection.  My great-uncle, Electrician’s Mate 2nd Class Lawrence C. Jones, served aboard ASTORIA as a plankowner from her commissioning on 17 May 1944 until she returned to the US mainland following the surrender of Imperial Japan in September 1945.

Uncle Lawrence was 30 years old and married when he was drafted in the summer of 1943.  He appeared for his induction in San Antonio and declared that he would prefer to serve in any branch of the military save one.  “Anything but the Navy!” he stated, according to his brother Ray (who served at the same time in the U.S. Coast Guard.)  Lawrence was promptly sent to Navy recruit training followed by Electrical School at the University of Minnesota.

Jones transferred to the New York Navy Yard, where he worked for the next several months before reporting to the Philadelphia Navy Yard to join the crew of the new CLEVELAND-class light cruiser USS ASTORIA CL-90.  He reported aboard at commissioning on 17 May 1944.

As his brother tells it, Uncle Lawrence “didn’t like the water, didn’t like to swim, didn't even like to take a bath.”  Yet from June 1944 through September 1945, he and his shipmates remained at sea, ever farther from the country they served and the families they fought for.

In later years my great-uncle didn't speak often of his time aboard ship, and he passed away in 1994.  I have since learned that he had stayed active in the Mighty Ninety association until he left us, and his name was among those read in memoriam at the final CL-90 reunion in 1996.

In 2007 I set out to research my uncle's experiences armed only with the knowledge of his name, rating, and ship assignment—not even his service number.  The Mighty Ninety website is the result of my ongoing research, and will continue to grow as more individuals contribute.  My intent is to breathe life into a chapter of WWII US Navy history that time has obscured, as well as to honor the experiences of men at sea under circumstances that tested the strongest of wills.

Although this website focuses on USS ASTORIA CL-90, much information contained herein comes from the documentation of her sister CLEVELANDs in Cruiser Division 17: PASADENA CL-65,
SPRINGFIELD CL-66, and WILKES-BARRE CL-103.  In many ways this is the collective story of four cruisers and the sailors who lived aboard them.


To Uncle Lawrence and the men he served with, this historical account is respectfully dedicated.
