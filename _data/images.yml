  caption: The first known aerial photograph of the commissioned USS Astoria CL-90, 7 June 1944. She is off Brandywine Shoal in final preparation for her shakedown cruise. Her first wartime livery is the light-pattern disruptive measure 33 design 24d. This measure, originally developed for use in the northern Pacific and Aleutian Islands, was intended to disrupt the ship's outline most effectively in hazy, overcast conditions. Astoria is easy to identify in photographs because she was the only cruiser in the Pacific to wear this camouflage measure through March 1945.
